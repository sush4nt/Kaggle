# Kaggle_DS
## Learnings through Kaggle Datasets <br />
Problems included in these repository have helped me draft a workflow in my methodology: <br />
   1. Data Preparation : Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning
   2. Feature Exngineering : perform Feature Extraction, Selection and Scaling.
   3. Model Training : Training an ML algorithm and perform model evaluation. 
   4. A hierarchical approach to problem-solving using simple-to-complex solutions to a problems in Supervised Machine Learning( Regression and Classification)
