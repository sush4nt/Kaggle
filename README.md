# Kaggle_DS
## Learnings through Kaggle Datasets: <br />
Problems included in these repository have helped me draft a workflow in my methodology: <br />
   1. Data Preparation: Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning.
   2. Feature Exngineering : perform Feature Extraction, Selection and Scaling.
   3. Model Training: Training an ML algorithm and perform model evaluation. 
   4. A hierarchical approach to problem-solving using simple-to-complex solutions to problems in Supervised Machine Learning.
   5. Using classes and functions to implement DRY.
   6. Exposure to various ML libraries.
   
   
## Usecases:

1. Regression
2. Classification
3. Time-series Analysis
4. Natural language processing
5. Recommender systems
6. Computer vision
